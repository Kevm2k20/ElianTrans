# ElianTrans
G00367608
This application takes in user imput of a single character 
in order to translate it into Elian script
This was easier than taking in entire strings and i think better as 
it doesnt overload the user withe odd Elian characters
i weanted to go with a simple dark theme 
the application saves the last letter 
that the user searched for before they closed the application last
and displayes it in the english and Elian lexicons
